# Machine-Learning-Model-Selection-and-Class-Balancing
This repository contains a comprehensive tutorial on Machine Learning Model Selection for Multivariate Analysis with Anonymized Data. It covers data preprocessing, class balancing strategies (specifically undersampling), and model evaluation, leading to the deployment of the best-performing machine learning model.

Overview

In this project, we go step-by-step from the definition of the business problem to selecting the best machine learning model and preparing it for deployment. The dataset used is anonymized, adding a layer of complexity as the variables lack descriptions. The project covers the following:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, outliers, and scaling.
Class Balancing: Using undersampling to address the class imbalance problem.
Model Selection: Training multiple models, applying cross-validation, and optimizing hyperparameters.
Model Deployment: Choosing the best model for deployment based on various evaluation metrics.
Dataset

The dataset is anonymized and includes 179 columnsâ€”178 input features and 1 target variable. The target variable indicates whether or not a customer renewed their insurance policy.

Preprocessing

Steps involved in preprocessing include:

Handling missing values.
Scaling numerical features.
Addressing outliers.
Splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets, while preserving the prevalence of the target class.
Class Balancing

Due to the imbalance in the target class (20% positive, 80% negative), the project implements undersampling on the majority class to balance the dataset for training.
